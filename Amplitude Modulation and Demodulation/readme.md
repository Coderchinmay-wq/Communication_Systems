# Experiment 02 – Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation

## Aim

To study the function of Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation
and to calculate the modulation index.

---

## Objectives

- Generate an Amplitude Modulated (AM) signal.
- Observe the AM waveform using an oscilloscope.
- Measure maximum and minimum envelope amplitudes.
- Calculate the modulation index.
- Demodulate the AM signal.
- Compare the recovered signal with the original message signal.

---

## Theory

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a modulation technique in which the
amplitude of the carrier signal is varied according to the amplitude
of the message signal.

For proper envelope detection:

- Carrier frequency must be much greater than message frequency.
- The modulation index should not exceed unity for conventional
  AM without over-modulation.

### Types of Modulation

| Modulation Index | Type |
|---|---|
| M < 1 | Under modulation |
| M = 1 | Perfect modulation |
| M > 1 | Over modulation |

## Circuit

### AM Modulator

The AM modulator is implemented using the BC107 transistor
configuration specified in the laboratory manual.

### AM Demodulator

The demodulator uses a diode detector followed by an RC
low-pass filter for recovering the message signal.

## Experimental Setup

The circuit was implemented on a breadboard and tested using:

- Function generator
- DC power supply
- Oscilloscope

The AM waveform was observed on the oscilloscope.

## Modulation Index

The modulation index is calculated using:

M = (Vmax - Vmin) / (Vmax + Vmin)

It can also be calculated using:

M = Vm / Vc

where:

- Vmax = maximum envelope amplitude
- Vmin = minimum envelope amplitude
- Vm = amplitude of message signal
- Vc = amplitude of carrier signal

## Observation Table
| No. | Vmax (V) | Vmin (V) | M = (Vmax-Vmin)/(Vmax+Vmin) | Vm (V) | Vc (V) | M = Vm/Vc |

| 1   |          |          |                             |        |        |           |
| 2   |          |          |                             |        |        |           |
| 3   |          |          |                             |        |        |           |

## Demodulation

The AM signal is applied to the diode detector and RC low-pass filter.

The recovered output is compared with the original message signal.
